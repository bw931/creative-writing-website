	<!--COMMENT: the html 'link' element links a CSS file to an HTML file so that CSS styling can be applied. It uses 3 attributes. 'rel' specifies the relationship between the current file and the file being linked to, in this case stylesheet. 'type' specifies the type of file being linked to. 'href' provides the URL of the file being linked to. We have also subsequently added links for a font stylesheet, and also to a URL that hosts Bootstrap-->
	
	<!--COMMENT: BOOTSTRAP also adds screen width responsiveness so that when changing the size of the screen, your webpage remains in proportion-->
	
	<!--COMMENT: When adding a number of stylesheets, they can often interfere and overcome one another.There are several ways to counteract this. Firstly, the order: the last stylesheet will naturally be given preference. It is also possible to name the stylesheets: either 'persistent'(leave as is), 'preferred'(add "a "title="XYZ"") or 'alternate'(add a "rel="alternate stylesheet"").
